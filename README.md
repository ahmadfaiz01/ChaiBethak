Overview
- The primary motivation for this project was to enhance the user interface and interactivity of our initial static website from Assignment 1. 
However, Due to team member changes, directly modifying the original assignment was not feasible. 
Therefore, we built this sample website from the ground up, adhering to the assignment requirements, and leveraging CSS and JavaScript to achieve a visually appealing, responsive, and interactive user experience.

Page Contributions:
- Arham Ali worked on the index.html (Home) and menu.html pages and CSS styling.
- Muhammad Ahmad completed the remaining pages and handled most of the JavaScript.
